1. function
Bayes_decesion_rule.m: a classifier using bayes decesion rule. Three inputs are train data, train label and test data; Output is predicted label;
Fisher_discriminant_analysis.m: a classifier using Fisher discrminant anaylysis. Three inputs are train data, train label and test data; Output is predicted label;

2. main
three parts: 1. load data 2. test bayes decesion rule classifier 3. test Fisher discriminat analysis classifier

3.Outputs
print training accuracy of both classifiers.
Export predicted results as: pre_label_Bayes.mat and pred_label_Fisher.mat.

4. Results
Training accuracy of Bayers classifier is 97.5% and Fisher classifier is 80%.
